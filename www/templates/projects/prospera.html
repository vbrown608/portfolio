	<p>Open Disclosure is an Oakland campaign finance transparency app created by Code for America's Oakland volunteer "Brigade". The app is written in <strong>Ruby</strong> using the Sinatra framework. My focus for this project was to design and build charts in <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>D3</strong>.</p>

	<p>I built an interactive app showing campaign contributions by zip code and candidate, as well as a chart showing campaign contributions over time.</p>
